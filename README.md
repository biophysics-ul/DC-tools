# DC-tools
Custom Python tools for Deformability Cytometry (DC).  
These tools are designed for **reusability** rather than speed. 
The repository contains two main modules:
### dc_tools.py
This module provides functions for working with and analyzing DC images. It supports images stored in a ZIP file or images stored in a RTDC format. For the latter, it uses [**dclab**](https://github.com/DC-analysis/dclab).

### ml_tools.py
This module offers functions for ML-based model training and image classification.
It is independent of DC (and dc_tools.py) and works with images stored in ZIP files.
Machine learning is based on PyTorch and can utilize a GPU.
